## Rock the Code

## Features

In this project, I was inspired by a backend system for a banking entity, where users, after registering, will be able to sign up for bank services:

- Debit card
- Credit card

To sign up, you must log in.

> The system encrypts and compares passwords, and if they are correct, it generates a token using JWT.

## Tech

- NODE.JS
- EXPRESS:JS
- MONGOOSE
- JWT
- NODEMON -D

## scripts

- NPM RUN DEV
- NPM RUN START
- NPM RUN SEED

```sh
With npm run seed, we will register 10 test users in our database.
```
